<p>The website is about a user being able to lend books, courses or articles. this website has two target groups. Admin and borrower. An Admin can do everything on the page regarding CRUD a course, book or article. In addition, Admin has the same page as the borrower has (I mean that Admin can also lend books, for example). The borrowed page contains nothing but a text field that can fill in the code that has had from Admin to show what he has lent in his profile or page. NOTE: instead of giving the code to the borrower so it can be resolved through the Admin page by going to a specific user and adding the book, course or article that the borrower has ordered.</p>
